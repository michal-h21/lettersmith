**[DEPRECATED]**

See [lettersmith_py](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith_py) for a fresh take on the problem, written in Python. I love you Lua, but Python had batteries... so many batteries.

Lettersmith
===========

Lettersmith is a simple, flexible, fast  _static site generator_. It's written in [Lua](http://lua.org).

Lettersmith's goals are:

- Simple
- Flexible: everything is a plugin.
- Fast: build thousands of pages in seconds or less.
- Embeddable: we're going to put this thing in an Mac app so normal people can use it.

Lettersmith is open-source and a work-in-progress. [You can help](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith/issues).


What does it do?
----------------

Lettersmith is based on a simple idea: load files as Lua tables. So this:

`2015-03-01-example.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Trying out Lettersmith
---
Let's add some content to this file.
```

...Becomes this:

```lua
{
  relative_filepath = "2015-03-01-example.md",
  title = "Trying out Lettersmith",
  contents = "Let's add some content to this file.",
  date = "2015-03-01"
}
```

- The file contents will end up in the `contents` field.
- You can add an optional [YAML](http://yaml.org/) headmatter block to files. Any YAML properties you put in the block will show up on the table!
- Date will be inferred from file name, but you can provide your own by adding a `date` field to the headmatter.

The function `lettersmith.paths(directory)` returns a table of file paths in that `directory`, sorted by file name. You can then transform those paths using plugins.

The most basic plugin is `lettersmith.docs(paths_table)`. It takes a Lettersmith
paths table and returns an iterator of tables.

```lua
local paths = lettersmith.paths("raw")
local docs = lettersmith.docs(paths)

for doc in docs do
  print(doc)
end

--[[
{
  relative_filepath = "foo/x.md",
  contents = "...",
  date = "2014-10-17"
}
...
]]--
```


Creating a site
---------------

Creating a site is simple. Just create a new lua file. Call it anything you like.

```lua
local lettersmith = require("lettersmith")
local render_markdown = require("lettersmith.markdown")

-- Get paths from "raw" folder
local paths = lettersmith.paths("raw")

-- Render markdown
local docs = lettersmith.docs(paths)
docs = render_markdown(docs)

-- Build files, writing them to "www" folder
lettersmith.build("www", docs)
```

That's it! No fancy classes or complex conventions. Just a convenient library for transforming files with functions.

What if you want to combine a series of plugins? No problem. Lettersmith plugins are composable:

```lua
-- ...
local comp = require("lettersmith.transducers").comp

local blog_post = comp(
  render_permalinks ":yyyy/:mm/:slug",
  use_meta { site_title = "..." },
  render_markdown,
  lettersmith.docs
)

local blog_single = comp(
  render_mustache "templates/blog_single.html",
  blog_post
)

local blog_archive = comp(
  render_mustache "templates/blog_archive.html",
  paging "page/:n/index.html",
  blog_post
)

build("www", blog_single(paths), blog_archive(paths))
```


Plugins
-------

In Lettersmith, everything is a plugin. This makes Lettersmith small, simple and easy to extend.

Lettersmith comes with a few useful plugins out of the box:

* Write [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with [lettersmith.markdown](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith/blob/master/lettersmith/markdown.lua)
* Use Mustache templates with [lettersmith.mustache](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith/blob/master/lettersmith/mustache.lua)
* Generate pretty permalinks with [lettersmith.permalinks](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith/blob/master/lettersmith/permalinks.lua)
* Add site metadata with [lettersmith.meta](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith/blob/master/lettersmith/meta.lua)
* Hide drafts with [lettersmith.drafts](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith/blob/master/lettersmith/drafts.lua)
* Generate automatic RSS feeds with [lettersmith.rss](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith/blob/master/lettersmith/rss.lua)

<!--
Pressed for time? The [lettersmith.blogging](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith/blob/master/lettersmith_blogging.lua) plugin bundles together Markdown, pretty permalinks, RSS feeds and more, so you can blog right out of the box.

Here's a simple blogging setup, using [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) templates:

```lua
local lettersmith = require("lettersmith")
local use_blogging = require("lettersmith.blogging")
local use_mustache = require("lettersmith.mustache")

local docs = lettersmith.docs("raw")

docs = use_blogging(docs)
docs = use_mustache(docs, "templates")

lettersmith.build(docs, "out")
```
-->

Of course, this is just a start. "Plugins" are really just functions that modify a list of tables. This makes Lettersmith simple. It also means it is extremely flexible. Lettersmith can be anything you want: a website builder, a blog, a documentation generation script... If you need to transform text files, Lettersmith is an easy way to do it.


Creating new plugins
--------------------

Don't see the feature you want? No problem. Creating a plugin is easy! "Plugins" are really just functions that return an iterator function.

For example, let's write a plugin to remove drafts:

```lua
local function remove_drafts(iter)
  return coroutine.wrap(function()
    for doc in iter do
      if not doc.draft then
        coroutine.yield(doc)
      end
    end
  end)
end
```

We typically use Lua `coroutines` to create iterators because they're lazy, allowing us to build 1000s of files without consuming too much memory at once.

Lettersmith provides some handy tools for transforming iterators: `lettersmith.transducers` and `lettersmith.lazy`. Let's use these to rewrite the drafts plugin:

```lua
local filter = require("lettersmith.transducers").filter
local transformer = require("lettersmith.lazy").transformer

local remove_drafts = transformer(filter(function (docs)
  return not doc.draft
end))
```


What's so great about static sites?
-----------------------------------

Why use Lettersmith?

- The most important reason: it's simple.
- Blazing-fast sites on cheap hosting. Run-of-the-mill servers like Apache and nginx can serve thousands of static files per second.
- You can't hack what doesn't exist. Static sites aren't prone to being hacked, because they're entirely static... there is no program to hack.
- Your data is in plain text. No databases to worry about, no export necessary. Want to take your data elsewhere? It's all there in text files.
